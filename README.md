## FEHM: Finite Element Heat and Mass Transfer Code ##
### LA-CC-2012-083 Export control on source code ###

This repository is limited to FEHM team collaborators with a LANLS approved and signed Contributor Agreement.
This Version 3.3 from October 2017 has been moved from a mercurial repository on https//fehm.lanl.gov which will be closed.

The following are reminders for FEHM code developers using this repository.

A Git workflow follows these basic steps:
* Make changes to files
* Add the files (‘stage’ files)
* ‘Commit’ the staged files
* Push the commit (containing all modified files) to the central repo
 
1. To first get the repo, run the command

```
git clone https://github.com/lanl/FEHM.git
```

This will download the FEHM Git repo to your current directory.
 
2. Let’s say you’ve done some editing and you’re ready to push your changes to the FEHM repository.
Run the command

```
git add file1 file2 ... fileN
```
 
to add any files you have changed. You can also just run `git add .` if you want to add every changed file.
 
3. Now, run
 
``` 
git status
```
 
This gives an overview of all tracked and untracked files.
A tracked file is one that Git considers as part of the repo.
Untracked files are everything else – think of *.o files, or some test data output generated by an FEHM run.
 
Tracked files can be:
* Unmodified (you haven’t made any changes to it, relative to the last commit)
* Modified (you have edited the file since the last commit)
* Staged (the file has been added and is ready to be committed and then pushed)
 
You can make an untracked file become tracked by using `git add` on it.
 
4. After verifying (with `git status`) that all the files you want to be pushed are properly staged, commit them using

```
git commit -m "My first Git commit!"
```
 
Then, push the files onto the GitHub repo with

```
git push origin master
```
 
5. If someone else has made edits, you will need to pull their changes to your local FEHM clone before you can push.
 
```
git pull origin master
```
This can be done at any step.
