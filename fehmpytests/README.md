## fehmpytests python driven test suite for FEHM ##

Fehmpytests is a new test suite for FEHM. The goal is to enable FEHM developers to easily test new code and add new tests 
for existing or future functionality. To meet these goals, fehmpytests uses the Python “unittest” module and a general test 
method that can be called for each new test case. 
Currently, there are twenty tests that fehmpytests performs through a command line interface. 
Future plans are to integrate it into the FEHM build process and provide more modularity by improving the developer interface.
